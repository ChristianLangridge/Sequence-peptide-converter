# Personal projects
Learning how to code in Python, a long road ahead to becoming a bioinformatician 

**File descriptions**:  

codon.py -> converts ACTG nucleotides into ACUG RNA codons 

amino-acid.py -> converts ACUG RNA codons into amino acids 

nucleotide to amino-acid.py -> combines condon.py and amino-acid.py to directly get amino acids from nucleotides
