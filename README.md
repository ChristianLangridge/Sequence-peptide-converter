# Personal project
A short, educational bioinformatics project while I learn how to code in python. 

**File descriptions**:  

codon.py -> converts ACTG nucleotides into ACUG RNA codons 

amino-acid.py -> converts ACUG RNA codons into amino acids 

protein.py -> converts amino acids into protein with AlphaFold API 

full.decoder.py -> combines all steps into one script
